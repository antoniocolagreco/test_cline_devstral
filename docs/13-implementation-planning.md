## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles

1. **API-First Development**: Design and document endpoints before implementation
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for core business logic
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, add features incrementally
4. **Data Integrity**: Prioritize database constraints and validation
5. **Security by Design**: Consider security implications at each phase

### Priority Rationale

- **Authentication Last**: Core functionality should work without authentication first
- **Items Before Characters**: Characters depend on items for equipment
- **CRUD Before Features**: Basic operations before advanced features
- **Testing Throughout**: Add tests as features are implemented

### Risk Mitigation

- **Phase Dependencies**: Each phase builds on previous phases
- **Rollback Strategy**: Each phase should be independently deployable
- **Feature Flags**: Use configuration to enable/disable features
- **Database Migrations**: Version all schema changes

### Success Criteria

- **Phase 1-4**: Core API functionality without authentication
- **Phase 5-7**: Complete feature set with testing
- **Phase 8-9**: Secure, authenticated API
- **Phase 10**: Production-ready deployment
